# Your Text, Your Style – PPT Generator
This app converts text or Markdown into a PowerPoint deck using your uploaded template.

# Technical Details 
The app accepts long-form prose or Markdown and normalizes it (removing extraneous whitespace, preserving heading hierarchy, and respecting list structure). It then generates a structured slide specification via an LLM using a clear JSON schema defined in prompts.py (fields such as title, bullets, callouts/quotes, charts/placeholders, optional speaker_notes). The llm_providers.py adapter routes requests to OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini using the user-supplied API key; if no key is provided or a call fails, a deterministic fallback heuristic splits content by Markdown headings, semantic cues (lists, paragraphs, transitions), and length thresholds to determine a reasonable number of slides. Optional one‑line guidance (e.g., “investor pitch deck”) nudges the prompt to shape tone, emphasis, and structure. The outcome is a sized slide plan that balances information density with readability, avoiding a fixed slide count.

How the app applies the template’s visual style and assets
template_style.py inspects the uploaded .pptx/.potx to extract theme colors, fonts, masters/layouts, background fills, and image shapes. For each slide spec, ppt_builder.py selects the closest matching layout, populates title and content placeholders, preserves bullet nesting, and applies the template’s font families, sizes, and color accents. Where the template contains image placeholders or existing pictures, the app reuses those assets by cloning shapes or copying slides as donors—no AI image generation occurs. When images are absent, the slide remains clean while maintaining the template’s spacing and margins. Notes (if enabled) are attached using python-pptx’s notes slide API. The process is non‑destructive and template‑first: styles are inherited, not recreated, to maximize fidelity to the original design.
